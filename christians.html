      The former president addressed a summit at Palm Beach, Florida, last Friday (July 26th). He is recorded saying, “...you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.” The comment drew controversy across the Internet, especially among liberal news sources.  </p>

    <h3 class = "header">The Facts</h3>
    <p>
      Trump was a speaker at “The Believer’s Summit,” a three-day event for Christians to deepen their faith. After speaking about topics such as Second Amendment Rights, strong foreign policy, and border security, Trump turned to the topic of votes. He says, 
      “I love you Christians … [but] you got to get out and vote,” he said. “In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” 
      This remark drew immediate alarm from many prominent figures and news sources. For example, the former California Senator Adam Schiff wrote on X, “This year democracy is on the ballot, and if we are to save it, we must vote against authoritarianism. Here Trump helpfully reminds us that the alternative is never having the chance to vote again.” His opinion is echoed in news articles from many major left-leaning news outlets such as <a class = "link", href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/us/politics/trump-votes-christians.html">The New York Times</a> and <a class = "link", href = "https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-interview-fox-news-ingraham-vote-anymore-christians-rcna164337">MSNBC</a>.

      On the other hand, conservative figures and news organizations were not as agitated over Trump’s comments. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said, “I think he’s obviously making a joke about how bad things had been under Joe Biden, and how good they’ll be if we send President Trump back to the White House so we can turn the country around” during an interview with CNN. Like Cotton, Governor Chris Sununu of New Hampshire was not as fazed by Trump’s words. He said, “I think he’s just trying to make the point that this stuff can be fixed. Obviously, we want everybody to vote in all elections. But I think he was just trying to make a hyperbolic point that it can be fixed as long as he gets back into office.”

    <h3 class = "header">The Opinions</h3>
    <p>
      While the facts are listed above, the juxtaposition between the tone and additional details in each article was startling. Below, we will go over the differences between these articles.
    </p>
    <h4 class = "sub-heading"> Liberal</h4>
    <p>
      The two liberal articles we reviewed were written by MSNBC and The New York Times. Both highlighted how they believed that Trump was a major threat to democracy. They focused on the former president’s comments, specifically about how he once mentioned he would like a third term, though he later clarified it was a joke. They painted Trump as a radical Republican who could go as far as to eliminate the Electoral College. Most of the major accusations against Trump were from MSNBC, which has a bias rating of -3.71 according to All Sides (in which -6 is the most liberal and 6 is the most conservative). 

    </p>
    <h4 class = "sub-heading">Center</h4>
    <p>
      The two center articles seemed to stick more to general facts. They included a few tweets from both Democrats and Republicans, but didn’t elaborate on their opinions like the liberals and conservatives did. 

    </p>
    <h4 class = "sub-heading">Conservative</h4>
    <p>
      Very few conservative news sources reported on Trump’s quote. Even the ones we were able to find were vague and stuck to direct quotes. They were shorter than the liberal articles, and were composed of quotes and well known facts.
